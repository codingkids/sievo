Programming assignment
======================

Write a console application which reads some input data, transforms the data
according to the following instructions and finally outputs the results to console.

The application should support the following command line arguments (only the first
one is mandatory):

-File <path>             full path to the input file
-SortByStartDate         sort results by column "Start date" in ascending order
-Project <project id>    filter results by column "Project"

The following requirements define the program functionality 
and refer to the data sample below:

* Input data is tab-separated UTF-8 text with a header row.

* It only includes the columns listed below.

* Dates (Start date) and money (Savings amount) values conform to certain 
  format presented below.

* Columns "Savings amount" and "Currency" can have missing values denoted
  as NULL. Those should be printed as empty strings.

* Column "Complexity" has a certain set of values (Simple, Moderate, Hazardous). 
  The program should report an error if a source value differs from those three
  but keep in mind that more options (e.g. "VeryHigh") can be added in the future.

* The output should also have a header line.

* Lines that are empty or start with comment mark # are skipped.

* Order (but not names) of columns might be changed in future.

* In case of an invalid source value (in a date, money or Complexity column) a
  descriptive error message should be printed to console and the program terminated.

Please think about this assignment as a real project. Feel free to use any libraries you
would on the job. The goal is to demonstrate, what kind of code you write for a living
and see that you share our enthusiasm for code quality. We value maintainability, elegance
and clarity over individual presentations excellence.

The output should have the same format as input, so no need e.g. to align the columns.

The end result of the assignment must contain source code for the application and unit
tests. It must be possible to compile the code and run the application. Feel free to
choose any programming language you like.

If you are unable to finish the whole assignment then write down the problems you 
ran into so that we can discuss about them.

Deliver the source code as an encrypted zip file (if not encrypted the e-mail might 
not get through). Use password "Sievo". You can use e.g. Google Drive to share the file.
